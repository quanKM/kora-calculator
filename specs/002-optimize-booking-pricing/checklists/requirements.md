- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- The specification clearly defines the "gapless" rule for 1-day combos and the UI change for 1-hour granularity.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were used as the user's instructions were specific.
- Assumptions: The "gapless" rule applies only to consecutive 1-day combos as explicitly requested.
